# ddos-regression-analysis
This project introduces a behavioral fingerprint of DDoS traffic, by analyzing the pattern of packet length and number of packets. It uses a univariable linear regression model to predict the expected volume (total size of packets) based on the number of packets.  
The model is built on the intrusion detection evaluation dataset (CIC-IDS2017) by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). Exact sample used is the Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX.csv.
